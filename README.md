    ______________________Basics__________________________
</h3>

<p>every website sterts with "!doctype html" surrounded with (shift, and shift.).next, you write html with(shift, and shift.)on the next line, write head surrounded by (shift, and shift.)
after that, write meta charset="utf-8" surrounded by(shift, and shift.)you are almost done. after that, write /head surrounded by (shift, and shift.), then body surrounded by (shift, and shift.). once you get there, you can type things. to start typing, enter h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, or p surrounded by (shift, and shift.) h "number" changes how big the text will be, and p is a paragraph. once you do that, close it with /body surrounded by (shift, and shift.), then close you website with /html surrounded by (shift, and shift.).
<h3>______________________Color_________________________</h3>
<p>right now, your websit is probally looking pretty bland, and could use some color. if you want to add color, go into head, and add style surrounded by (shift, and shift.), then select what part you want to color, h1-h6, or p, then follow it by{
enter}. inside of {enter}, write color;: inside of ;:, write a color, or write rgb(). if you want to change the background color of your webpage, do the same thing, but instead of doing h1-h6, or p, write body and do the same thing.
